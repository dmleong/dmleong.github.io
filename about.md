I'm an Oakland-based software engineer with a passion for diversity in tech, cheese, motorcycles, dinosaurs, and any combination of the aforementioned.

I'm the creator and founder of <a href="https://feerless.us">Feerless</a>, an app that provides crowd-sourced, preemptive notifications for Netflix watchers with PTSD. You can download it on the Chrome store <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feerless/jplkbfficcokellnmmmnlleiolmcfbln">here</a>!

I'm currently an application engineer at GitHub, working to improve the safety of the platform for underrepresented minorities.

I'm passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in tech, and I was one of the founding members of Skittles, Twilio's diversity initiative. In my spare time, I teach public high school students how to code through the non-profit organization <a href="http://missionbit.com/">Mission Bit</a>, and volunteer at <a href="http://www.lpfi.org/">Level the Playing Field Institute</a> (LPFI) hackathons.

In my spare spare time, I enjoy long rides on my motorcycle, following cute puppies on Instagram, and growing impressively gross callouses on my hands from rock climbing.
