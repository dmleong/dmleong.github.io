Consent is something that isn't discussed frequently enough in our society. Consent means to _freely and willingly participate in an activity, without coercion or fear of repercussions_.

In other words, it's an enthusiastic *YES, PLEASE!*

Here's a quick video I love that compares consent to a cup of tea:

Consent matters in the bedroom (at least 1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted over the course of their lifetime), but it also matters in software. Users are ____ likely to leave a product if there's a popup on a website. _____ study shows that a breach in trust in a product means that users are less likely to use a product. [Pew research studies here]

But, you might say, asking for permission kills the mood and lowers our metrics. Isn't it better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission?

## Asking for forgiveness instead of permission is a privileged experience

Asking for forgiveness is only permissible if it comes from a place of power. Since software is largely written by straight white cis able-bodied affluent men who benefit from having a lot of privilege, it's no surprise that software tends to assume consent. Many straight white men have never been in a position where they've lacked the benefit of the doubt. Thus, the software that comes out of Silicon Valley tends to assume consent by default because the people writing the code have never thought to, or felt they needed to question if something is okay or not.

But lest this turn into a #NotAllMen post, hear me out: consent benefits everyone in society, even the straight white males! When everyone gives enthusiastic and informed consent, we have more engaged users, higher ROI, and better user experiences.

## What is consensual software?

Consensual software means getting _explicit consent from users to interact with them or their data_.

- Don't assume a user wants to receive a notification. Don't assume it's okay to share their data. Ask first.
- Respect their wishes if they don't want you to do something.
- Continue respecting their wishes if they don't want you to do something.

A great example of non-consensual software if Facebook selling users' data to advertisers. Once users found out that their (presumably) private information was being sold to third parties and they had no control over it, they were outraged. I can't count how many "boycott Facebook" posts I saw. _Users want to have control over their experiences_.

## Great examples of consensual software

For as long as I can remember, Apple's wifi network suggestions have been the bane of my life. Go on the train? Wifi notification. Go into a coffee shop for a second? Wifi network notification. Look, Apple, if I want to join a wifi network _I will let you know_.

To my surprise, in iOS 10, Apple now asks you if you want to join wifi networks when you're in range. Thanks for asking, Apple!

## Measuring success

"But what about my key metrics like clicks and newsletter signups?" you ask,

Well, dear reader, perhaps we are focusing on _the wrong metrics_. Instead, let's focus on improving our NPS - Net Promoter Score - and focus on our superfans. If I love a product, I am happy to read blog posts, share news, and - most importantly - spend money. If I receive an unwanted popup to the face before I've even read your blog post, I'll likely never come back - and I'll tell my friends how awful of an experience it was.

Enthusiastic and consensual users love products. Or if they dislike something, they're happy to give you honest feedback instead of drifting away and ignoring your calls.

## How to start

How do we start building consent into software? Start by asking yourself "do my users want this? Have they given me explicit permission to do this?" If you're not sure, ask! If you're thinking more about yourself and improving your numbers, then perhaps you have the wrong priorities.

Users always know if you're not being truthful. A breach of trust will cost you.
