*Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, nor do I claim to speak for everyone who has experienced trauma or has PTSD.I also recognize that I have a level of privilege and resources available to me that others may not. These are my own experiences and thoughts that I hope will help others going through similar situations.*

One of the hardest things to do is live with yourself after trauma.

There's an intense amount of shame and guilt. You survived. But sometimes you wish you hadn't. You are free to live your life, but what does that even mean anymore?

I have PTSD. I've had it for years after being sexually assaulted several times over the past 10 years. My last assault completely broke my spirit and sent me into a spiral known as [Rape Trauma Syndrome (RTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_trauma_syndrome). I didn't know what was wrong until I read [The Sexual Healing Journey: A Guide for Survivors of Sexual Abuse](https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Healing-Journey-Guide-Survivors-ebook/dp/B0083DHILK?ie=UTF8&btkr=1&redirect=true&ref_=dp-kindle-redirect) and realized _I needed help_. I sought professional help and it's led me on one of the most painful, yet rewarding journeys of my life so far.

## Forgive yourself
